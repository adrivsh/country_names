##USAGE

* iso3_to_wb_name matches iso3 to the name of the country using the spelling that the World Bank likes to use
* iso3_WBname_iso2_uni_undp_fasotat_gaul provides even more correspondences
* names_to_iso matches several possible spellings of the country names to iso3, iso2 and iso number codes.

##GOTCHAS

* The European Union uses codes that look like iso2 but are actually slightly different. EU uses "EL" for "GR" (Greece in iso2) and "UK" for "GB" (Great Britain in iso2).
* Some people use old iso3 codes. replace "ROM" with "ROU" and "ZAR" with "COD" to go from old to new iso3
